            <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
            <p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.</p>

        <header>History</header>
        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989</p>
        <p>Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.</p>

        <header>Syntax and semantics</header>
        <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional.</p>
        <p>some of the statements and control flow  are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if)</li>
            <li> The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.</li>
            <li>The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
            <li>The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.</li>
            <li>The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.</li>
        </ol>
